We had notable success off the field as well: five members of our choir were named to the All-Shore Chorus and two were named All-State. Twenty members of our band earned All-Shore honors, while we had one All-Region band honoree and one All-State band member. We once again had county, regional, state or national accomplishments by participants in FCCLA, Consumer Bowl, Forensics, FFA, Drama, Art Club, and Newspaper.
